<hr />
<h3>Forrest Gump</h3>
<p>
  The expeirence of watching this movie feels like going on an adventure. It
  fills with one and a childish curiosity and positivity for the world. It also
  reminds us of our basic nature to be kind to others and to care about everyone
</p>
<h3>Beasts of No Nation</h3>
<p>
  This movie is a must watch for those who want to engage with the actual
  reality of this world for many others. We must be grateful for what we have
  and care about helping other, and this movies shows us the underbelly of this
  world as catalyst for that.

<h3>Sucker Punch</h3>
<p>
  An amazing movie with amazing effects and mindblowing fight scenes. However,
  the plot is very sad
